PROJECT 2

Our code design starts from the professor's provided repository, and follows 
the instructions and directions he provides in his videos. We also began with
plenty of time and were grateful to receive guidance from the TAs Jose
and Fernando.

The test files fork.c, exec.c, join.c, kill.c, exit.c are included, and have been 
added to the makefile in the test directory. They are ready to be compiled and run.

fork(), exec(), join(), and kill() seem to work as expected.
